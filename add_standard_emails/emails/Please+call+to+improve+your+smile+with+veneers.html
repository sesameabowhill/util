<p>Dear [Recipient], </p>
<p></p>
<p>We enjoyed having you in the office today and
appreciate the
opportunity to explore &ldquo;upgrading&rdquo; your smile with new
veneers. As you know, veneers are
custom-made,
ultra-thin shells that are placed on your teeth to provide an enhanced
look and
feel. Since veneers&nbsp;cover the surface
of the teeth, they are difficult to stain and will not decay. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The many patients we have treated with veneers
rave about
the great look, feel, and comfort they provide.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I am confident you will be very pleased as well.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="color: black;">Call today at</span> <span
 style="color: red;">[phone]</span> or email us the days and times that
would work
best for you <span style="color: black;">at</span> <span
 style="color: red;">[email]</span>
so that we can find a convenient first appointment time.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="color: black;">I look </span>forward
to helping
you achieve the smile you want!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>Dr. <span style="color: red;">[dr name]</span></p>
