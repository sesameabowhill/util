<p>Dear [Recipient], </p>
<p></p>
<p>We enjoyed having you in the office today and
appreciate the
opportunity to explore &ldquo;upgrading&rdquo; your smile with new
veneers. As you know, veneers are
custom-made,
ultra-thin shells that are placed on your teeth to provide an enhanced
look and
feel. Since veneers&nbsp;cover the
surface of the teeth, they are difficult to stain and will not decay. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In addition, we are now able to give you veneers
that
require little or no preparation to the teeth.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That means that we will not have to drill or remove any of your
existing
tooth structure. Your prep-less veneers
will be placed right on top of your existing teeth for a
natural-looking smile.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="color: black;">Call today at</span> <span
 style="color: red;">[phone]</span> <span style="color: black;">or
email us the days
and times that would work best for you</span> <span
 style="color: black;">at</span>
<span style="color: red;">[email]</span> <span style="color: black;">so
that we can
find a convenient first appointment time.</span></p>
<p></p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>Dr. [dr name]</p>
