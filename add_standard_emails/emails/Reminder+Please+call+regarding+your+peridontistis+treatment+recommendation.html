<p>Dear [Recipient],</p>
<p></p>
<p>Just about every day, we have patients who call or
come in
for extensive treatment that could have been avoided.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For example, gum disease starts small and,
if left untreated, can grow to be an extensive and expensive disease in
the
mouth that can rapidly become an overall health risk for:</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="disc">
  <li>Heart disease</li>
  <li>Diabetes </li>
  <li>Stroke</li>
  <li>Tooth loss</li>
  <li>Complications for women who are
pregnant and more</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Patients who put off treatment tell us that they
wish they had
received the needed treatment immediately after the condition was
diagnosed.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because we hear that so
often from patients, we like to do everything we can early on to help
our
patients get the treatment they need before things get more
complicated,
extensive, and expensive.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="color: black;">Call today at </span><span
 style="color: red;">[phone] </span><span style="color: black;">or
email us at </span><span style="color: red;">[email]</span><span
 style="color: black;"> to schedule your
appointment for your needed treatment </span>and/or to let us know
what we can
do help you accomplish your goals for your mouth and your health. Your wellness is very important to us. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>Dr. <span style="color: red;">[dr name]</span></p>
