<p>Dear [Recipient], </p>
<p></p>
<p>We enjoyed having you in our office today. As you know, our goal is the same as yours;
to help you gain and maintain a healthy smile for a healthy life. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Today we scheduled initial treatment for
periodontal
disease, the first stage of gum disease (also known as gingivitis).
Periodontal
disease is an infection in the gums, deep tissues, and bones that
support your
teeth. (&ldquo;Periodontal&rdquo; means
&ldquo;around the
tooth.&rdquo;) The bacteria in the
built-up
plaque on your teeth are producing poisons, or toxins, that irritate
the gums,
causing infection. It is similar to the
irritation and infection around a splinter in your hand.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Just as the infection tries to break down the
bacteria around the splinter and push it out of your body, periodontal
infection tries to fight the bad bacteria in your gums and breaks down
your
bones and tissues that hold your teeth in place. </p>

<p>When you come for your appointment, we will remove
plaque
and tartar from your teeth that are irritating your gums.<span>&nbsp;
</span>With proper home care and regular dental
visits, periodontal disease can be controlled so that it does not
progress to
further stages which can cause you to lose your teeth.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Congratulations on making the right decision to
treat your periodontal
disease now. </p>
<p></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see you at <span style="color: red;">[appt
time] </span>on
<span style="color: red;">[appt date]</span>. Your appointment will
take
approximately one hour.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>Dr. <span style="color: red;">[dr name]</span></p>
