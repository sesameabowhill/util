<p>Dear [Recipient], </p>
<p></p>
<p>We
enjoyed your visit today in the office and appreciate
the opportunity to discuss the benefits of Invisalign with you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Invisalign uses a series of clear, removable, comfortable aligners that
no one
can tell you're wearing. Not only are
the aligners &ldquo;invisible,&rdquo; they are removable, so you can
eat and drink what you
want, when you want. </p>
<p></p>
<p>
Each set of aligners is worn for about 2 weeks and removed from time to
time to
eat, drink, brush, and floss. As each
aligner is worn and then replaced with the next in the series, your
teeth will
move &ndash; little by little, week by week &ndash; until they have
straightened to the
final position we have prescribed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You'll visit us about once every 6 weeks to ensure that things
are
progressing as planned. </p>
<p></p>
<p>At the initial visit, we will take impressions,
which are
used for planning your treatment with Invisalign&rsquo;s 3-D computer
imaging
technology. At the next visit, you receive your first aligner, and can
view
your own virtual treatment plan and see how straight your teeth will
look when
treatment is complete. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The initial appointment takes less than an hour.
Subsequent
appointments will be only about 15 minutes. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Call today at <span style="color: red;">[phone]</span>
to
schedule your first appointment &mdash;or email us the days and time of
day that
would work best for you at <span style="color: red;">[email],</span>
so that we
can find you a convenient appointment time. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>Dr. <span style="color: red;">[dr name]</span></p>
