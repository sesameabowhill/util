<p>Dear [Recipient], </p>
<p></p>
<p>We enjoyed having you in the office today and are
looking
forward to &ldquo;upgrading&rdquo; your smile with new
&ldquo;prep-less&rdquo; veneers. Veneers
are custom-made, ultra-thin shells
that are placed on your teeth to provide an enhanced look and feel. Since your veneers will&nbsp;cover the
surface of your teeth, they are difficult to stain and will not decay. In addition, we are now able to give you
veneers that require little or no preparation to the teeth. That means that we will not have to drill or
remove any of your existing tooth structure.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Your prep-less veneers will be placed right on top of your
existing
teeth for a natural-looking smile.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You have made a great decision: you are getting a
bright
smile with teeth that look and feel natural. I am confident you will be
very pleased
with your new smile!</p>
<p></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see you at <span style="color: red;">[appt
time]</span>
on <span style="color: red;">[appt date]</span>. Your appointment will
take
approximately<span style="color: red;"> [length of time]</span>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>Dr. <span style="color: red;">[dr name]</span></p>
