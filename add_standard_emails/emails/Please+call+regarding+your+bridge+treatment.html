<p>Dear [Recipient],</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks for your time, attention, and trust<span
 style="color: black;"> during our visit</span> today.<span>&nbsp;
</span>As you know, our goal is the same as yours:
to help you gain and maintain a healthy smile for a healthy life. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Today we discussed the benefits of a bridge. A bridge is a great way to
&ldquo;replace&rdquo; a
missing tooth or teeth with an artificial tooth that is attached to the
teeth
on either side. It is just like a bridge
over a river in that it &ldquo;bridges&rdquo; the gap between your
teeth with a
natural-looking tooth replacement. Our
goal is to make it look, feel, and work great.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The procedure takes approximately <span
 style="color: red;">[time]</span>
hours. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Give us a call to schedule your appointment and
let us know
what we can do to help you move in the direction you want to go for
your <span style="color: black;">smile </span>and your overall health. <span style="color: black;">Call today at</span>
<span style="color: red;">[phone] </span><span style="color: black;">or
email us at</span>
<span style="color: red;">[email]</span> <span style="color: black;">to
schedule
your appointment.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>Dr. <span style="color: red;">[dr name]</span></p>
