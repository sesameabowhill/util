<p>Dear [Recipient], </p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="color: black;">We enjoyed having you
in the
office today.</span> <span>&nbsp;</span>As we discussed,
you are a good candidate for teeth whitening.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Since your smile is one of the first things that people notice
when they
meet you, whitening your teeth can be a powerful way to make a
memorable first
impression. </p>
<p></p>
<p>As you know, teeth are darkened by drinking
coffee, tea,
cola, red wine and just day-to-day use. The <b>ZOOM! </b>whitening
process
lightens discoloration, whitening your teeth up to 8 shades.&nbsp;Zoom!
takes less than an hour and gives you
immediate results that are safe and comfortable. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Give us a call today <span style="color: black;">at
</span><span style="color: red;">[phone]</span> to schedule your Zoom!
whitening appointment or email us the days and time of day that would work best for
you <span style="color: black;">at</span> <span style="color: red;">[email]</span>,
so that
we can find you a convenient appointment time. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>Dr. <span style="color: red;">[dr name]</span></p>
