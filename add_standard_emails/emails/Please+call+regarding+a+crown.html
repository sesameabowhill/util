<p>Dear
[Recipient],</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="color: black;">Thanks for your
attention and your
trust during our visit today. As you
know, our goal is the same as yours: to help you gain and maintain a
healthy
smile for a healthy life.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="color: black;">Today </span>we
discussed the
benefits of a crown on tooth #<span style="color: red;"> [tooth #]</span>.<span
>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A crown is like a good, solid roof on a
house. It helps create a strong, sturdy
structure that protects your tooth for longer, better use.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Just like a leaky roof, without a crown, your
tooth can leak, crack, and eventually break down. <span
 style="color: black;"></span></p>
<p></p>
<p>The first step in the process is to schedule an
appointment
where we will take the initial steps to prepare your tooth, take an
impression
of your tooth, and then send that impression to our lab<span
 style="color: black;">,
which</span> will create a beautiful restoration. Your
crown will be custom-designed just for
your mouth. In the meantime, we will
make a temporary crown that will protect your tooth while your
permanent crown
is being made over the following couple of weeks. During
the follow up visit, we will remove
the temporary and cement in the permanent crown. </p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="color: black;">Call today at</span> <span
 style="color: red;">[phone] </span><span style="color: black;">or
email us at</span>
<span style="color: red;">[email]</span> <span style="color: black;">to
schedule
your appointment. </span>It is the best
thing you can do to improve the health of your mouth and longevity of
your
teeth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks again for your trust and for giving us the
opportunity to serve you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>Dr. <span style="color: red;">[dr name]</span></p>
