<p>Dear [Recipient],</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was good to see you today.<span>&nbsp;
</span>As you know, we have scheduled your next
appointment for a crown on tooth # <span style="color: red;">[tooth #]</span>.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>A crown is like a good, solid roof on a house. It helps create a strong, study structure
that protects your tooth for longer, better use. Just
like a leaky roof, without a crown, your
tooth can leak, crack, and eventually break down. You
made a great decision for the long-term
health of your mouth. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In addition, when you come in, you&rsquo;ll save a
lot of time
because we use CEREC technology, which allows us make your crown right
in the office
in a single visit, where it would normally take at least two. You will go home with a new tooth-colored
restoration that will look and feel great. </p>
<p></p>
<p>We are looking forward to seeing you at <span
 style="color: red;">[appt time]</span> on <span style="color: red;">[appt
date]</span>.
Your appointment will take approximately <span style="color: red;">[length
of
time]</span>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks again for your trust and for giving us the
opportunity to serve you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>Dr. <span style="color: red;">[dr name]</span></p>
