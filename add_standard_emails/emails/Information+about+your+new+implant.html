<p>Dear [Recipient],<strong></strong></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>We enjoyed having you in the office today,
and we are
looking forward to getting started with your dental implant. Dental implants are the ideal way to replace
missing teeth and restore your mouth&rsquo;s natural ability to
comfortably chew and
eat, while giving your mouth the stability it needs to bite properly. It is also the best way to ensure the
long-term health of the rest of your mouth. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p><span>&nbsp;</span>A dental implant
is a
synthetic tooth root that looks like a bolt, placed in your jawbone. The &ldquo;root&rdquo; is usually made of
titanium (the
same material used in many replacement hips and knees), a metal that is
well-suited to pairing with human bone. A replacement tooth or dental
crown is
then attached on top of the &ldquo;root.&rdquo;</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Dental implants are preferable to
conventional bridges and
dentures &mdash; they look more natural, feel and act more like natural
teeth, and
give you a much stronger bite. Best of
all, people love the comfort and confidence that dental implants
provide. And because they don't rely on
neighboring
teeth for support, implants don't compromise the health of your natural
teeth.
In fact, while bridges are only expected to last 7-10 years, implants
can last
a lifetime. That is a great investment
in your health and your quality of life.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>We&rsquo;ll see you at <span
