<p>Dear [Recipient], </p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks for your attention and your trust during
our visit
today. As you know, our goal is the same
as yours: to help you gain and maintain a healthy smile for a healthy
life.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am sure you are as concerned as I am about the
periodontitis we diagnosed and discussed today, which is an infection
that
occurs in the gums, deep tissues, and bones that support your teeth.
(&ldquo;Periodontal&rdquo; means &ldquo;around the tooth.&rdquo;)<span
>&nbsp;
</span>We observed &ldquo;pockets&rdquo; or spaces where your infected
gums have begun to
separate from your teeth. If left untreated, these pockets can grow
larger,
causing damage to your gums and eroding the bone around your teeth.
It&rsquo;s like
the foundation of a house that is crumbling and eroding.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Just as a safe and secure home must have a
solid foundation, your teeth need healthy gums and bones to hold them
in place
for life. <span>&nbsp;</span>Making the right treatment
decision today can firm up that &ldquo;foundation&rdquo; for a
healthier mouth and teeth
tomorrow. </p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>The next important step is to schedule an
appointment where
we will remove the plaque and tartar from your teeth where a regular
cleaning
can&rsquo;t reach: under the gum line or around the
&ldquo;foundation&rdquo; of your teeth. It
is similar to the difference between
washing your car and having it detailed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Detailing reaches the most difficult areas, leaving things fresh
and
clean again. Just like
&ldquo;detailing,&rdquo; we
will be leaving a healthy, clean surface on your teeth above and below
the gum
line.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That way it will be easier for
the gum tissue to reattach to the tooth.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This appointment will take about an hour.</p>
<p></p>

important appointment, or email us the days and time of day that would

best for you, so that we can find you a convenient appointment time. <span

<p></p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>Dr. <span style="color: red;">[dr name]</span></p>
