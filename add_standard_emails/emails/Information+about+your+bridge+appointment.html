<p>Dear [Recipient],</p>
<p></p>
<p>We enjoyed having you in our office today. Congratulations on your decision to get a
bridge. A bridge is a great way to
&ldquo;replace&rdquo; a missing tooth or teeth with an artificial tooth
that is attached to
the teeth on either side. It is just
like a bridge over a river in that it &ldquo;bridges&rdquo; the gap
between your teeth with
a natural-looking tooth replacement. Our
goal is to make it look, feel, and work great. You made a good decision for your appearance and the health of
your
mouth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are looking forward to seeing you for your
appointment at
<span style="color: red;">[appt time]</span> on <span
 style="color: red;">[appt
date]</span>. Your appointment will take approximately <span
 style="color: red;">[length
of time]</span>. We appreciate the
opportunity to serve you. Thanks for
your trust as we move forward together. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>Dr. <span style="color: red;">[dr name]</span></p>
