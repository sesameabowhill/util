<p>Dear
[Recipient],</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="color: black;">Thanks for your
attention and your
trust during our visit today. As you
know, our goal is the same as yours: to help you gain and maintain a
healthy
smile for a healthy life.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="color: black;">Today we discussed the
benefits of
a</span> crown on tooth #<span style="color: red;"> [tooth #]</span>. <span
>&nbsp;</span>A crown is like a good, solid roof on a
house. It helps create a strong, sturdy
structure that protects your tooth for longer, better use.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Just like a leaky roof, without a crown, your
tooth can leak, crack, and eventually break down. It
may be the best decision you can make for
the <span style="color: black;">long-term</span> health of your mouth
and your
teeth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In addition, when you come in, you&rsquo;ll save a
lot of time
because we use CEREC technology, which allows us to make your crown
right in
the office in a single visit, where it would normally take at least
two. You
will go home with a new, tooth-colored restoration that will look and
feel
great. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Call today at <span style="color: red;">[phone] </span>or
email us at <span style="color: red;">[email]</span> to schedule your
appointment. <span>&nbsp;</span>Your
mouth will appreciate it and your teeth will be that much happier when
you
smile!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks again for your trust and giving us the
opportunity to
serve you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>Dr. <span style="color: red;">[dr name]</span></p>
