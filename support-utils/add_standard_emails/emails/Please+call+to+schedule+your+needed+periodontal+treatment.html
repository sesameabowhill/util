<p>Dear [Recipient], </p>
<p></p>
<p>We enjoyed having you in our office today. As you know, our goal is the same as yours:
to help you gain and maintain a healthy smile for a healthy life.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At your appointment, we discovered periodontal
disease, the
first stage of gum disease (also known as gingivitis).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Periodontal disease is an infection in the
gums, deep tissues, and bones that support your teeth.
(&ldquo;Periodontal&rdquo; means
&ldquo;around the tooth.&rdquo;) The
bacteria in the
built-up plaque on your teeth are producing poisons, or toxins, that
irritate
the gums, causing infection. It is
similar to the irritation and infection around a splinter in your hand. Just as the infection tries to break down the
bacteria around the splinter and push it out of your body, periodontal
infection tries to fight the bad bacteria in your gums and breaks down
your
bones and tissues that hold your teeth in place. </p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>The earlier gum disease is treated, the less
damage it can
potentially do to your teeth and your overall health.<span>&nbsp;
</span>We want to do everything we can to help you
get the treatment you need. Call us at<span

email us at
<span style="color: red;">[email]</span> with any questions or concerns
you have
about your condition and to schedule your next appointment for this
needed
treatment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The appointment will only take about an hour. </p>
<p></p>
<p>We look forward to helping you onto the next step
in health
and wellness.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>Dr. <span style="color: red;">[dr name]</span></p>
