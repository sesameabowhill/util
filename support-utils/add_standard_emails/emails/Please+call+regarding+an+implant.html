<p>Dear
[Recipient], </p>
<p></p>
      <p><span style="color: black;">Thanks for your
attention and your
trust during our visit today. As you
know, our goal is the same as yours: to help you gain and maintain a
healthy
smile for a healthy life.</span></p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Today we discussed the benefits of dental
implants, which
are the ideal way to replace missing teeth and restore your
mouth&rsquo;s natural
ability to comfortably chew and eat, while giving your mouth the
stability it
needs to bite properly. It is also the
best way to ensure the long-term health of the rest of your mouth. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>A dental implant is a synthetic tooth root
that looks like a
bolt, placed in your jawbone. The
&ldquo;root&rdquo;
is usually made of titanium (the same material used in many replacement
hips
and knees), a metal that is well-suited to pairing with human bone. A
replacement
tooth or dental crown is then attached on top of the
&ldquo;root.&rdquo; </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Dental implants are preferable to
conventional bridges and
dentures &mdash; they look more natural, feel and act more like natural
teeth, and
give you a much stronger bite. Best of
all, people love the comfort and confidence that dental implants
provide. And because they don't rely on
neighboring
teeth for support, implants don't compromise the health of your natural
teeth. In fact, while bridges are only
expected
to last 7-10 years, implants can last a lifetime. That
is a great investment in your health and
your quality of life.</p>
