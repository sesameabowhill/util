<p>Dear [Recipient], </p>
<p></p>
<p>We enjoyed having you in our office today. As you know, our goal is the same as yours:
to help you gain and maintain a healthy smile for a healthy life. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Today we scheduled your next appointment for
treatment of
gum disease, also known as periodontitis.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Periodontitis is an infection of the gums, tissues, and bones
that
support your teeth. (&ldquo;Periodontal&rdquo; means &ldquo;around the
tooth.&rdquo;) We observed
&ldquo;pockets&rdquo; or spaces where your
infected gums have begun to separate from your teeth. If left
untreated, these
pockets can grow larger, causing damage to your gums and eroding the
bone
around your teeth.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s like
the
foundation of a house that is crumbling and eroding.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Just as a safe and secure home must have a
solid foundation, your teeth need healthy gums and bones to hold then
in place
for life. You made the right treatment
decision
to strengthen your &ldquo;foundation&rdquo; so that you won&rsquo;t
lose your &ldquo;house&rdquo; (your
teeth). </p>

<br>
<p>When you come for your appointment, we will remove
the
plaque and tartar from your teeth where a regular cleaning can&rsquo;t
reach: under
the gum line or around the &ldquo;foundation&rdquo; of your teeth. It is similar to the difference between
washing your car and having it detailed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Detailing reaches the most difficult areas, leaving things fresh
and
clean again. Just like
&ldquo;detailing,&rdquo; we
will be leaving a healthy, clean surface on your teeth above and below
the gum
line.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That way it will be easier for
the gum tissue to reattach to the tooth. </p>
<p></p>
<p>We are looking forward to seeing you for your
appointment at
<span style="color: red;">[appt time]</span> on <span
 style="color: red;">[appt
date]</span>. Your appointment will take
approximately one hour.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks again for your trust.<span>&nbsp;
</span>We look forward to moving together along the road to a healthier
smile
and a healthier life.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>Dr. <span style="color: red;">[dr name]</span></p>
