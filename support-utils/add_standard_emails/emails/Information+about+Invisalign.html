<p>Dear [Recipient], </p>
<p></p>
<p>Congratulations on your decision today to
straighten your
teeth with Invisalign. </p>
<p></p>
<p>
Invisalign uses a series of clear, removable, comfortable aligners that
no one
can tell you're wearing. Not only are
the aligners &ldquo;invisible,&rdquo; they are removable, so you can
eat and drink what you
want, when you want. </p>
<p></p>
<p>
You will wear each set of aligners for about 2 weeks, removing them
only to
eat, drink, brush, and floss. As you
wear each aligner and then the next in the series, your teeth will move
&ndash;
little by little, week by week &ndash; until they have straightened to
the final
position we have prescribed. You'll
visit us about once every 6 weeks to ensure that things are progressing
as
planned. </p>
<p></p>
<p>At your initial visit, we will take impressions
which are
used for planning your treatment with Invisalign&rsquo;s 3-D computer
imaging
technology. At the next visit, when you receive your first aligner, you
will be
able to view your own virtual treatment plan and see how your straight
teeth
will look when your treatment is complete. We&rsquo;ll also show you
how many
aligners are needed to complete your treatment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The initial appointment takes less than an hour.
Subsequent
appointments will be only about 15 minutes. </p>
<p></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see you at <span style="color: red;">[appt
time]</span>
on <span style="color: red;">[appt date]</span>. <span

<p></p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>Dr. <span style="color: red;">[dr name]</span></p>
