<p>Dear
[Recipient],</p>
<p></p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking forward to seeing you soon for
your oral
cancer screening. As you know, we
strongly recommend annual oral cancer screening for all patients. Oral
cancer
is one of the most curable diseases when it's caught early. We use the
ViziLite
Plus&nbsp;exam, which identifies any soft tissue abnormalities in your
mouth.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s quick and easy. First, you&rsquo;ll rinse with a cleansing
solution, and then we examine your mouth using a specially designed
light
technology. The ViziLite Plus exam is painless and fast and can be done
as part
of your upcoming hygiene appointment. The ViziLite Plus exam costs $[<span
 style="color: red;">x]</span> and could save your life. </p>
<p></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see you at <span style="color: red;">[appt
time]</span>
on <span style="color: red;">[appt date]</span>. <span
 style="color: red;"></span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>Dr. <span style="color: red;">[dr name]</span></p>
