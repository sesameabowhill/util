<p>Dear [Recipient], </p>
<p></p>
<p>We enjoyed having you in our office today. As you know, our goal is the same as yours:
to help you gain and maintain a healthy smile for a healthy life. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Today we scheduled your next appointment for root
therapy
(also known as root canal) on your tooth # <span style="color: red;">[tooth
#]</span>,
which has become inflamed and infected.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Left untreated, it can progress to further pain, abscess, and
loss of
your tooth.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Root therapy is a
routine
procedure that is kind of like having your house treated for termites. Just like termites work silently, eating the
inside structure of a house, infection has attacked the inside of your
tooth. When you treat for termites, the
bugs are
removed and the internal structure is reinforced for a strong and
sturdy
building. That is the same thing we will
be doing for your tooth: removing the infection and reinforcing the
internal
structure of your tooth, so it can continue working for you in the
future like
it has done in the past.</p>

mouth and your
teeth. Thanks for your trust. </p>
