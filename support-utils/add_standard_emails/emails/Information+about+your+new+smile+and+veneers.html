<p>Dear [Recipient], </p>
<p></p>
<p>We enjoyed having you in the office today and are
looking
forward to &ldquo;upgrading&rdquo; your smile with new veneers. Veneers are custom-made, ultra-thin shells
that are placed on your teeth to provide an enhanced look and feel.
Since your
veneers will&nbsp;cover the surface of your teeth, they are difficult
to stain
and will not decay. </p>
<p></p>
<p>At your next appointment, we will start preparing
your teeth
as well as take impressions so that our lab can custom-make your
veneers. In the meantime, we will make
temporary
veneers that will look like and function very similar to your
custom-made veneers. When everything
arrives back from the lab,
you will come in to have the temporaries removed and the permanent
veneers put
on. </p>
<p></p>
<p>You have made a great decision: you are getting a
bright
smile with custom-shaped teeth that look and feel natural. I am
confident you
will be very pleased with your new smile!</p>
<p></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see you at <span style="color: red;">[appt
time]</span>
on <span style="color: red;">[appt date]</span>. Your appointment will
take
approximately<span style="color: red;"> [length of time]</span>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>Dr. <span style="color: red;">[dr name]</span></p>
