<p>Dear [Recipient], </p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="color: black;">Thanks for your
attention and your
trust during our visit today. As you
know, our goal is the same as yours: to help you gain and maintain a
healthy
smile for a healthy life.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>As you know, we discovered today that the root of
your tooth
[tooth #] has become inflamed and infected.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Left untreated, it can progress to further pain, abscess<span
 style="color: black;">,</span> and loss of your tooth.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This type of infection is serious and needs
to be treated immediately. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Treatment for this type of infection is called
&ldquo;root therapy&rdquo;
(also known as a root canal). Root
therapy is a routine procedure that is kind of like having your house
treated
for termites. Just like termites work
silently, eating the inside structure of a house, infection has
attacked the
inside <span style="color: black;">of</span> your tooth.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When you treat for termites, the bugs are
removed and the internal structure is reinforced for a strong and
sturdy
building. That is the same thing we will
be doing for your tooth: removing the infection and reinforcing the
internal
structure of your tooth so it can continue working for you in the
future like
it has done in the past.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The procedure takes approximately <span
 style="color: red;">[time]</span>
hours<span style="color: black;">, and now most patients describe it as
no more
difficult than having a cavity filled</span>. <span>&nbsp;</span><span
 style="color: black;">Call today at</span>
<span style="color: red;">[phone] </span><span style="color: black;">or
email us at</span>
<span style="color: red;">[email]</span> right away to schedule your
treatment&mdash;or
email us the days and time of day that would work best for you, so that
we can
find you a convenient appointment time. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>Dr. <span style="color: red;">[dr name]</span></p>
