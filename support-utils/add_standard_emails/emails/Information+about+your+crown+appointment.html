<p>Dear [Recipient],</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was good to see you today.<span>&nbsp;
</span>As you know, we have scheduled your next
appointment for a crown prep on tooth #<span style="color: red;">[tooth
#]</span>.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A crown is like a good,
solid roof on a
house. It helps create a strong, study
structure that protects your tooth for longer, better use.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Just like a leaky roof, without a crown, your
tooth can leak, crack, and eventually break down. You
made a great decision for the long-term
health of your mouth. </p>
<p></p>
<p>When you come in, we will take the initial steps
to prepare
your tooth, take an impression of your tooth, and then send that
impression to
our lab, which will create a beautiful restoration.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Your crown will be custom designed just for
your mouth. In the meantime, we will
make a temporary crown that will protect your tooth while your
permanent crown
is being made over the following couple of weeks. During
the follow up visit, we will remove
the temporary and cement in the permanent crown. </p>
<p></p>
<p>We are looking forward to seeing you at <span
 style="color: red;">[appt time]</span> on <span style="color: red;">[appt
date]</span>.
Your appointment will take approximately <span style="color: red;">[length
of
time]</span>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks again for your trust and for giving us the
opportunity to serve you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>Dr. <span style="color: red;">[dr name]</span></p>
